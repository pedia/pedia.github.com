Facebookis now the <a target=_blank target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/06/23/AR2008062302094.html">theworld's most popular social networking site</a> and one of the ways they've gottenthere is by being very focused on listening to their users and improving their userexperienced based on this feedback. Below are screenshots of the old and new versionsof the pages and a discussion of which elements are changed and the user scenariosthe changes are meant to improve. </p>
        <h4>Homepage Redesign</h4>        <p>OLD HOME PAGE: <img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3061/2694048463_da7d6f6ac9.jpg?v=0"></p>
        <p>NEW HOME PAGE: <img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3096/2694048603_d1be66e964.jpg?v=0"></p>
        <p>The key changes and their <em>likely</em> justifications are as follows</p>
        <ul><li>            <p>Entry points for creating content are now at the top of the news feed. One of thekey features driving user engagement on Facebook is the News Feed. This lets a userknow what is going on with their social network as soon as they logon to the site.In a typical example of network effects at work, one person creates some content byuploading a photo or sharing a link and hundreds of people on their friend list benefitby having content to view in their News Feed. If any of the friends responds to thecontent this again benefits hundreds of people and so on.&nbsp; The problem with theold home page was that a user sees their friends uploading photos and sharing linksand may want to do so as well <u><strong>but there is no easy way</strong></u> forher to figure out how to do the same thing without having to go two or three clicksaway from the home page. The entry points at the top of the feed will encourage more"impulse" content creation. </p>
          </li><li>            <p>Left sidebar is gone. There were three groups of items in the left nav; a search box,the list of a user's most frequently accessed applications and an advertisement. Thekey problem is that the ad is in a bottom corner of the feed. This makes it easy forusers to mentally segregate that part of the screen from their vision and either neverlook there or completely ignore it. Removing that visual ghetto and moving ads tobeing inline with the feed makes it more likely that users will look at the ad. Ah,but now you need more room to show the ad (all the space isn't needed for news feedstories). So the other elements of the left nave are moved, the search box to theheader and the list of most accessed applications to the sidebar on the right. Nowyou have enough room to stretch out the News Feed's visible area and advertisers canreuse their horizontal banner ads on Facebook even though this makes the existingfeed content now look awkward. This is one place where monetization trumped usability. </p>
          </li><li>            <p>Comments now shown inline for News Feed items with comments (not visible in screenshot). This may be the feature that made Mike Arrington decide to call the new redesignthe <a target=_blank target="_blank" href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/07/21/the-friendfeedization-of-facebook/">FriendFeedizationof Facebook</a>. Sites like <a target=_blank target="_blank" href="http://www.friendfeed.com/">FriendFeed</a> haveproven that showing the comments on an item in the feed inline gives users more contentto view in their feeds and increases the likelihood of engagement since the user maywant to join the conversation. </p>
          </li></ul>        <h4>Profile Redesign</h4>        <p>OLD PROFILE: <img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3048/2694048509_88f3bbf3e7.jpg?v=0"></p>
        <p>NEW PROFILE: <img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3118/2694048561_ee14174ba0.jpg?v=0"></p>
        <p>The key changes and their <em>likely</em> justifications are as follows</p>
        <ul><li>            <p>The profile now has tabbed model for navigation. This is a massive improvement fora number of reasons. The most important one is that in the old profile, there is a <strong><u>lot</u></strong> ofcontent below the fold. My old profile page is EIGHT pages when printed as opposedto TWO pages when the new profile page is printed. Moving to a tabbed model (i) improvespage load times and (ii) increases number of page views and hence ad impressions. </p>
          </li><li>            <p>The Mini-Feed and the Wall have been merged. The intent here is to give more visibilityto the Wall which in the old model was below the fold. The "guest book"or wall is an important part of the interaction model in social networking sites (seedanah boyd's <a target=_blank target="_blank" href="http://www.danah.org/papers/FriendsterMySpaceEssay.html">Friendsterlost steam. Is MySpace just a fad?</a> essay) and Facebook was de-emphasizing theirsin the old model. </p>
          </li><li>            <p>Entry points for creating content are at the top of the profile page. Done for thesame reason as on the Home page. You want to give users lots of entry points for addingcontent to the site so that they can kick off network effects by generating contentwhich in turn generates tasty page views. </p>
          </li><li>            <p>Left sidebar is gone. Again the left sidebar is gone and the advertisement is movedcloser to the content, and away from the visual ghetto that is the bottom left ofthe screen. Search box and most accessed applications are now in the header as well.The intent here is also to improve the likelihood that users will view and react tothe ads. </p>
            <p>            </p>
          </li></ul>        <p>        </p>
